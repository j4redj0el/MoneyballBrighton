## Introduction 

The term ‘Moneyball’ originated from the 2003 book, Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game by Michael Lewis. Popularised by the hit movie ‘Moneyball’ starring Brad Pitt, it tells the story of how the Oakland Athletics (Oakland A’s) baseball team utilised data and sabermetrics to scout players and assemble a competitive team with one-third the budget of their rival teams.
