## Introduction 

The term ‘Moneyball’ originated from the 2003 book, Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game by Michael Lewis. Popularised by the hit movie ‘Moneyball’ starring Brad Pitt, it tells the story of how the Oakland Athletics (Oakland A’s) baseball team utilised data and sabermetrics to scout players and assemble a competitive team with one-third the budget of their rival teams.

## Data-Driven Scouting in The Premier League

The concept of Data-driven scouting and decision-making is not foreign in the Premier League, with teams like Brentford FC and Brighton FC building their squads based on statistical analysis and identifying undervalued player metrics to compete at the highest levels, all while operating on significantly smaller budgets.

How effective are their data-driven strategies?

## Aim of Project 

This project aims to explore how effective Brighton's 'Moneyball' Approach, and how the team consistently stays competitive in both the transfer market and in the Premier League
